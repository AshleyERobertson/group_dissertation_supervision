I tend to be quite structured as a supervisor, and this is one reason I developed this document, as it will outline the process for you in advance, so you know what to expect.

I have some below, but in our first group meeting, I will ask you to think about whether there are any you would like to add, or if there is anything you want to amend related to the points below.\n\nA.2.1 Communication\nI ask that all students working with me communicate with me, letting me know if they are unable to make a certain deadline or if something gets in the way of a task they had planned for a specific point in time. In return, I will communicate with you regularly, including when you can expect feedback, and will do my best to let you know if I have to delay something beyond what I had previously communicated.\n\n\nA.2.2 Attendance\nI ask that all students attend group sessions unless there is something urgent that has come up. Individual sessions are more flexible and can be cancelled if you feel that you don’t need to meet in a particular week (although please let me know in advance if this is the case). Group sessions are held for 1h every fortnight, with individual sessions being 30 mins, held in the weeks that we are not meeting as a group.\n\n\nA.2.3 Supportive space\nI want the dissertation group to be an encouraging, safe, space and the dissertation process to be an enjoyable (albeit challenging at points!) experience for everyone. This means that you should never hesitate to ask any questions (all questions are valid) and I’d like us all to work together to support each other. No one is perfect and we will all make mistakes during the process (including me). I’ve been supervising for quite a few years now and I haven’t yet managed to come across anything that we have been unable to sort after some discussion, so don’t worry about talking to me if something has gone wrong :)."

If this is the case, let me know and we can discuss options.\nAlthough it is unusual for this to be an issue, there will be a point where I am no longer able to look over drafts before the deadline. We will aim for dates before this, but my cut-off is that I don’t accept drafts once we reach 1st March. This is because it becomes very unlikely that I will be able to turn around feedback in time for you to be able to make meaningful changes by the submission .deadline in mid-March."

For dissertation section drafts, I will usually aim to provide feedback within two weeks. This is because drafts tend to be in semester 2, when I have most of my teaching. Depending on my teaching/marking commitments, this may take longer, but I will communicate with you about this at the time. You will also be able to see where you are in the ‘feedback queue’ in the shared deadlines document.\n\n\nA.6.2 What type of feedback you will receive\nI generally provide in-text comments, so that I can show you which part am I referring to in my feedback (where relevant). I will also give a global overview/summary. I will tend to focus on what can be improved, as this is the priority to help your writing develop. However, I will also let you know what you do well too.\n\n\nA.6.3 How you can ask for specific feedback\nIf you have specific parts you would like feedback on (e.g. if you are unsure about something), you can leave comments in your document (either at specific points or at the start) and I will respond to them when I am reading through. Try not to put the points you’d like feedback on in the message when you send the file to me, as I put the files elsewhere and don’t tend to refer back to messages. This makes it more likely that I’ll miss them if they aren’t contained in the document when I come to read it.\n\n\nA.6.4 What format should be sent for the drafts?\nAll documents (proposal, ethics, Intro, Methods, Results/Analysis) should be in Word. An exception to this is copies of standardised measures (this might be in pdf, which is fine)."

We will also spend time discussing certain aspects of the dissertation, and I will provide resources as appropriate.\nI have planned out the group sessions as follows (although these are subject to change if required):\nSemester 1\n\nWeek 1: Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\nWeek 3: Ethics, research questions\nWeek 5: Summarising papers, bullet point introductions\nWeek 7: Discussing the bullet point intros, participant recruitment, reducing perfectionism\nWeek 9: Collecting data, developing evaluation (intro)\nWeek 11: Structure (i.e. reverse outlines), JARS guidelines\n\nSemester 2\n\nWeek 1: Receiving and applying feedback, presenting work\nWeek 3: Analysis (quant and qual)\nWeek 5: Developing evaluation (discussion), linking in theory\nWeek 7: No-stakes presentations - everyone will present a 5 min summary of study findings so far (these can be very roughand initial if you haven’t completed analysis)\nWeek 9: Final group session - bring your questions\nWeek 11: Longer session: Celebration combined with practice talks for the UG conference/BPS conference\n\n\n\nA.7.2 Individual sessions\nIndividual sessions are dedicated slots each fortnight for you. Here, we will tend to catch up on how your project is going, and you will have the opportunity to ask questions. These may be used more often at certain points in the year (e.g. getting ethics together) than others (e.g. once your data collection is all set up).\nMost people come along every week, but if you find one week that you don’t need to meet, it’s not an issue - just let me know and we can cancel it."

The reason that I do it is so that I can see if there is anything I/your peers can do throughout the dissertation process to support your future plans.\nIf you don’t know what you want to do, this is also fine, but it is then about seeing if we can maximise development of your employability skills, which will then be helpful in whichever direction you decide to go in :)."

Through this book, we hope to provide some ideas of how you could incorporate group supervision in a way that works for you. You may or may not currently supervise in groups: either way, we will provide some ideas of activities you might want to try in group supervision, as well as make some suggestions about how you might want to structure group supervision.\nAlthough we come from a background of Psychology, we have purposely kept this resource general and open, so that it could apply to dissertation supervision across many disciplines."

Feel free to use any of these as they are, adapt them to the needs of your students, or perhaps the examples will inspire some of your own new ideas!\nBefore we made this joint resource, Ashley also developed a separate book detailing each structured session that she runs, with an overview of what’s covered for each one, along with links to resources.

This format is now quite common at conferences, as a way to concisely convey the key take-away messages of a study, allowing interested audience members to discuss more details with you afterwards.\nSome of the benefits of you doing this for your proposal are:\n\nYou clarify your key arguments/decisions by having to communicate them concisely\nYou can get informal feedback from the group before finalising your proposal document\nYou practice skills in presenting that you will use in your course and in future work settings\nYou get to see how others in the group are approaching issues that could inform your thinking/approach to your own study\n\nI have shared a template PowerPoint. It’s 5 slides and I would challenge you to be as concise as you can. Once you have prepared your proposal document, you can pick out the key points and add them to the slides. Remember that this is for informal feedback from the group - we’re not expecting you to get everything right first time and we will be a super supportive and encouraging audience!\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Accompanying resource\nThis activity has an accompanying PowerPoint template [link] - feel free to use or adapt this. Depending on their course, this may be one of the first presentations that students have given during their time at university, and they are only at the start of their dissertation. Therefore, I find it helpful to provide this scaffolding to help ease any nerves.\n\n\n5.1.3 Running the group meeting\nIn terms of the practicalities of running this group meeting, I ask students to share their slides in advance (for example, in a shared Teams folder) to allow a quick set up and smooth running on the day. I explain to students that – similar to many conferences – I will give them a 1-minute warning and then a “time up” signal.\nWe have time for questions after each Lightning Talk. It might be the first time that students are audience members for this type of academic talk, so it can be helpful to provide some guidance at the start of the session on what types of questions they might want to ask. Being mindful that some students can feel nervous about this type of talk, I offer them the option to stay standing up for questions or to rejoin the group for a more informal discussion around the table if they prefer.\nI like to aim for a supportive and encouraging tone in this session. I emphasis that this is about getting some practice and helpful feedback, not about getting everything perfect. To help create a positive atmosphere, I like to light-heartedly challenge my students to “win” at being the most supportive audience: lots of smiling and nodding!\nIt can be good to finish this session by inviting students to crowdsource their tips for giving this type of talk, based on what they learned from their experience as a presenter and an audience member. Afterwards, this can be a great stage to encourage students to reflect on their skills development: we provide some guidance on how to support this in Chapter 6 [link]."

    "text": "5.2 Presenting an Outline for a written section\nWritten by: Dr Holly Scott\nOne area that I wanted to support my students to improve was developing a cohesive and persuasive overall argument in the Introduction as to why their research question merits investigation. To support this, I invite students to produce a bullet point outline of their Introduction plan, focusing on convincing the reader of their study rationale. In a structured group meeting, students then talk the group through their outline. This offers the opportunity to clarify their ideas by concisely articulating them to the group, and to receive constructure feedback on areas for enhancement from their peers. For example, as naive readers/listeners, the group may highlight a gap in the logical progression of an overall narrative.\nWhile this example focuses on the Introduction and rationale, the same approach can be used for any section. For example, it may be useful for constructing a Discussion plan and targeting any areas you feel that students have found trickier, such as supporting their study limitations with evidence.\n\n5.2.1 Rationale to share with students\nHere is an example of explaining the rationale behind this activity to your students:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Rationale for Outline of a Written Section\n\n\n\nIt’s time to start planning for drafting the Introduction. For next week, I’d like you to prepare a bullet point outline of your Introduction section, where each bullet point briefly summarises one key step in your overall argument to convince your reader why this study should be done. You will share this outline and, at our meeting, talk the group through the outline for some feedback. Some of the benefits of doing this task are:\nYou will organise your thoughts and start to build a coherent narrative for your Introduction draft that covers all key arguments.\nYou will gain feedback from me and your peers on the logical progression of your outline, including constructive suggestions for improvements.\nYou will be able to use your finished outline to break down the task of drafting an Introduction into manageable chunks.\nYou will practice clear and confident verbal communication by articulating your ideas to the group, which is an important skill for the future.\nI have shared an example bullet point outline for the Introduction of one of my papers. This is simply one example of how this might look. Don’t feel that yours has to follow a similar structure: this is just an example of focusing on the logical progression of key arguments.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Accompanying resource\nI share this one-page resource with students on outlining an Introduction argument. Following the group meeting, I also share an Introduction progress tracker, where they can insert each key argument/paragraph and log their progress on e.g. gathering literature to support it, making notes, drafting and redrafting. Students have found this helpful to get over the daunting blank page when they begin drafting, as they can break the task down into manageable chunks.\nAs with all the resources in this book, you are welcome to use these as they are, adapt them, or take them as inspiration for creating your own.\n\n\n5.2.3 Running the group meeting\nOn a practical note, it is helpful if students share their written outlines in advance: for example, I create an “Introduction Outlines” tab on our shared OneNote with pages named for each student.\nIn the structured group meeting, each student in turn talks through their proposed outline, while the rest of the group listens out for whether the content, ordering and linking make sense to someone reading/listening for the first time. This forms the basis for useful wider group discussions on how to structure an Introduction, how to make links between ideas etc.\nThis is also a useful session to take some time to discuss how different students approach writing, including what they have found helpful or tricky in the past. This creates an opportunity to crowdsource some top tips, and for students to gain comfort knowing that they are not alone in finding some aspect of writing challenging. This can open nicely into a wider group discussion around issues raised, e.g. overcoming perfectionism."

    "text": "5.3 Peer Review\nWritten by: Dr. Holly Scott\nPeer review offers students a useful opportunity to view written work through the lens of a marker, engaging with the Intended Learning Outcomes of the assessment to identify strengths and recommend areas for improvement. Reviewing a peer’s draft can encourage students to think critically about aspects of writing that they want to emulate or avoid in their own work, and those who engage more critically have been shown to go on to earn higher grades (Yalch et al., 2019).\nDissertation students can engage in peer review of all sorts of materials: not only drafts, as in this example, but also proposals, ethics applications, materials etc. Peer feedback can be written and/or verbal: in this example, students share written feedback on a draft before a group meeting where this forms the basis for group discussion.\n\n5.3.1 Rationale to share with students\nHere is an example of explaining the rationale behind this activity to your students:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Rationale for Peer Review\n\n\n\nCongratulations on completing your Introduction drafts, what a great milestone! As discussed, we’re going to use this as an opportunity for some peer review. The advantage of engaging in this peer review task include:\n\nYou will benefit from added feedback on your draft, not just from me but also from a peer\n\nThe evidence shows that the process of reviewing others’ written work helps you to then improve your own\nYou will build experience of how teams work together to produce output (not just in research but all sorts of workplaces)\nYou will also develop important transferable skills in giving constructive feedback (both written and verbal)\n\nI have shared a peer review form with some questions for you to reflect on as you read your peer’s work this week. Remember that this is an opportunity to support each other by identifying what is already working well, what could be improved and importantly how it could be improved. Next week we will have a chance to discuss our feedback and crowdsource ideas to help with any common tricky areas.\n\n\nIn this message to students, I will also list who will be reviewing whose work. You can consider what will support the most useful feedback (for example, grouping together similar methods) as well as avoiding any pitfalls (such as not grouping students together who are working closely on shared pair or group projects, to prevent unintentional plagiarism).\n\n\n5.3.2 Accompanying resource\nHere is an example of a peer review form for Introduction drafts [link]. It is helpful to provide some structure and prompts like these for students to reflect on as they read and review. Feel free to adapt this to suit your own Intended Learning Outcomes or perhaps target common problematic areas of drafts that you have seen repeatedly.\n\n\n5.3.3 Running the group meeting\nIn terms of set up, I create a shared space (e.g. a Teams folder) where students upload their written feedback ahead of the meeting (say, 24 hours before). So far, I have always shared my own feedback comments for each student here as well, facilitating transparency. However, depending on your group of students each year, if there are any issues then you may consider it more appropriate to send feedback individually.\nAs with any interactive session, I like to set a supportive tone and start by reminding the group that all discussion should be encouraging and constructive. I have always been genuinely impressed by the quality of written feedback in my students’ peer reviews, with a consistent encouraging tone and concrete, constructive suggestions for enhancement. This in turn forms the basis for a very productive and supportive group session: for example, it can be useful for students to share experiences of what they found trickier in writing their drafts, to know that they are not alone.\nIn practice, during this meeting, I facilitate a group discussion focused on each student’s draft in turn, initially based on input from me and their peer reviewer (on what is working well and what areas they can focus on refining), then opening into a broader discussion about how some of these improvements can be achieved in any strong discussion (involving all group members). Where relevant, it can be encouraging to point out strong aspects of students’ work that are a good example: for instance, if one student has found it difficult to create logical links between paragraphs and another student’s work has good examples of achieving this."

    "section": "5.4 Evaluation of a Discussion section",
    "text": "5.4 Evaluation of a Discussion section\nWritten by Dr Ashley Robertson (jointly developed with Dr. Wil Toivo\nIn my experience, one of the areas that students find quite tricky to write for their dissertation is the Discussion section. It is also the only section that students do not receive feedback on from supervisors (in our School, students get feedback on Introduction, Methods and Results only). It can also be quite difficult for students to demonstrate more complex evaluation skills.\nTo support this, my colleague and I developed some materials to support students when writing a Discussion section, highlighting key issues that we often see. These were designed for use in labs for our research methods course, but we have since also used them in our group dissertation meetings. As we had had instances of students copying examples and only changing a few words, we chose a topic that was very different (postgraduate students’ confidence in surviving the zombie apocalypse), in order to encourage generalisation of the skills learned. To support this, we used GenAI to provide the basis for the ‘not so good’ examples.\n\n5.4.1 Rationale to share with students\nHere is an example of explaining the rationale behind this activity to your students:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Rationale for Evaluation of the Discussion\n\n\n\nIn the next session, we are going to do some activities to support you when you come to writing your Discussion. I have provided three different ‘not so good examples’ from a Discussion section: what points can you identify? In the group meeting, we will discuss what you found. We will then look at some better (not perfect!) examples and discuss these too. Finally, we will identify some actions that you can take to support the writing of your Discussion section.\nSome of the benefits of doing this task are:\n\nYou will be able to identify common mistakes that are made when writing Discussion sections\nYou will benefit from the wider discussion of the group around what staff look for and do not look for in a Discussion section\nYou will identify clear and actionable points that you can apply to your own writing of the Discussion section\nYou will practice discussing your ideas with your peers and staff, which is an important skill for the future\n\nI have shared three ‘not so good’ excerpts from a Discussion section. For each, identify some issues for each. We will then see what everyone in the group identified once we meet.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Accompanying resource\nHere is a copy of the excerpts we use for the Discussion evaluation activity.\nThere are three particular aspects of Discussion sections that we are looking at in this activity:\n\nExcerpt 1: Linking findings to the evidence base\nExcerpt 2: Limitations\nExcerpt 3: Implications\n\nWe have developed some notes for staff running this activity, with some of the strengths/limitations for each of the excerpts.\nPlease feel free to adapt the activities or the notes in a way that works for you in your own supervision.\n\n\n5.4.3 Running the group meeting\nTo set this up, I create a thread on Teams (I have a shared Teams channel just for my dissertation students and me) and post the excerpts along with the rationale. This allows students time to prepare if they prefer. The excerpts are very short, so if students don’t have time to read through them before the meeting, this is not a problem as I can give everyone a few minutes to do it there and then. I have included the excerpts as well as some notes for staff for this activity under ‘Resources’ above.\nI usually have printed copies of each of the excerpts (both ‘not so good’ and ‘better’), so we can see them. We go through the ‘not so good’ (1A, 2A and 3A) together and I facilitate a discussion on this. Once these issues have been identified, I show the students the ‘better’ examples (1B, 2B and 3B) one at a time. For each one, I give them a minute to read it and then we have a discussion about what was better about this example. There may also be some problems they identify too, as these are not designed to be perfect.\nThen, I ask each student to identify one thing that they’ve learned from the session to incorporate into their own Discussion section. I then ask them to write this down and commit to this as an action when they come to write or edit their Discussion."
