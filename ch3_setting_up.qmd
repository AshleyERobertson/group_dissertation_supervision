# Getting Set up for the Year Ahead {#set_up}

It can be useful to set up a few things in advance of starting supervision, as it can help make the process of group supervision smoother and more efficient. It also means that students will know where to access information, and better understand what they can expect during supervision (and what is expected of them).

## Transparency and communication  

 
## Practical resources 

 
### Setting expectations document
