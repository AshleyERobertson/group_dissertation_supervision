# Benefits of Group Supervision {#benefits}

One of the biggest assumptions that we have come across is that Group Dissertation Supervision is only possible if all students work on a single project (e.g. looking at different variables) together. 

However, this is not a requirement (and is not how we run our supervision!). In this chapter, we will cover different models to group supervision (including what we do), and why it can be beneficial to supervise dissertation students as a group, even if students are working on completely different projects. 

## Different models of Group Supervision 

There are many different models of dissertation and, indeed, many different models of supervising dissertation students as a group. 

[Creaven et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.90216){target="_blank"} detail different models of undergraduate dissertation supervision in Psychology in their paper. 

Thinking specifically about group supervision, these include:

- Consortium model
  - Consists of multiple groups of students across different Universities collaborating on one protocol and supervised by supervisor in their University
  - Example: [Button et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1475725719857659){target="_blank"} 
- Apprentice-Based Senior Thesis
  - Students collaborate together in small groups on one protocol; supervised by a single supervisor
  - Example: [Mickey-Steinmetz & Reid (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00196){target="_blank"} 
- Collective Academic Supervision
  - Students meet only as a group and undertake independent (but similar) projects, supervised by the same supervisor
  - Example: [Dautel (2020)](https://doi.org/10.53841/bpsptr.2020.26.1.18){target="_blank"}
- Laddered Model
  - Students are separated into three-person teams, with each team consisting of three students with differing levels of expertise (one experienced, one mid-level and one new to the group)
  - Example: [Detweiler-Bedell & Detweiler-Bedell (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00133){target="_blank"}
- "Cluster" projects 
  - Two members of staff collaborate to supervise students (in groups as well as individually) on projects sharing a) a topic, b) a research question, c) methods or d) type of data analysis. 
  - Example: [Freeman et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.53841/bpsptr.2020.26.1.39){target="_blank"}

There will be other models of supervision used, especially across different disciplines. 

### Our models of supervision

Each of us supervises both Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught students. We use slightly different models of supervision to each other, although both are closest to the 'Collective Academic Supervision' model described by Creavel et al. (2023). 

To provide some context, our Undergraduate supervision is for final year students who are on-campus, whereas our PGT supervision is for students who are completing their dissertation through Online Distance Learning (and are therefore based all over the world).

In this book, we will mainly discuss how we supervise for final year undergraduate students, as we have found it difficult to schedule group supervision for Online Distance Learning students. Saying this, our supervision approaches are not specific to undergraduate students and would apply equally well to postgraduates.

## Ashley's supervision model

Ashley holds a mixture of group and individual supervision, switching between the two on a weekly basis:

- Fortnightly group supervision (e.g. Weeks 1, 3, 5 and so on) 
  - Each supervision is 'themed', with focus on skill development and covering challenges that are consistent across all projects
  - Resources are passed on to students: [full breakdown of each session across two semesters can be found here](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/group_supervision/){target="_blank"}
  - Each session scheduled for around 1 hour, although the final session is longer
- Individual supervision (e.g. Weeks 2, 4, 6 and so on)
  - An example of ['Touching base' sessions](#supervision_types))
  - Individual sessions are dedicated time for students to ask questions, discuss project-specific challenges/concerns and identify priorities for progress
  - Actions noted for future sessions
  - Deadlines set using the 'joint deadlines document' (see [Chapter 3](#set_up))

## Holly's supervision model

Holly holds group supervision sessions on a weekly basis. She splits this between two different types of group supervision sessions:

- 'Milestone' group sessions
  - Around three milestone sessions are held per semester, each consisting of collaborative activities
  - With larger groups (e.g. six or more), these are scheduled for around 1.5 hours each
  - Students are asked to complete activities in advance and during each milestone session
  - Examples of activities covered in milestone sessions are in [Chapter 5](#supervision_examples)
- Regular group supervision (or ['Touching Base' session](#supervision_types))
  - Held on a weekly basis, in the weeks that there is no milestone session
  - Opportunity to catch up on progress, ask questions and plan progress
  - Actions noted for future sessions

## Why Supervise Dissertations as a Group? 

**ADD SOME GENERAL INFORMATION HERE, PERHAPS LINKING TO PAPERS**

Sometimes, one concern that staff have is that some groups are quieter than others. This one of the reasons that Ashley has [a clear theme and structure for each group session](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/group_supervision/). It can often take a little time for quieter groups to warm up, especially when there are no pre-established relationships. Try not to worry if groups are a little quiet at the start - this is typical and usually eases up over time. It often gets to the point that formerly quiet group sessions suddenly run the risk of overrunning due to the amount of discussion! 

### Feedback from students  

Here is just some of the feedback that students who have been supervised through group supervision in our School have left about their experiences. 

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Feedback from students

Group meetings were "motivating", "inspiring" and "comforting"

"Hearing other peopleâ€™s ideas and perspectives was so helpful"

"It was so lovely to get to feel a part of the community"

"Excellent, would honestly recommend this format"

:::

In general, students in our School report enjoying group supervision as it helps them to feel less isolated and they learn from their peers as well as their supervisor. It can also just be an enjoyable experience! 


### Benefits for students

In our experience, group supervision has been beneficial for the students that we have supervised:

- Student wellbeing
  - In our School often the students won't know their peers within their dissertation group. Working together can give valuable alternative perspectives and help students to connect with each other. This can help to facilitate feelings of connectedness among the cohort. 
- Support each other
  - EXAMPLE/INFO
- Gain experience of how teams work
  - EXAMPLE/INFO
- Develop transferable skills in collaboration
  - EXAMPLE/INFO

### Benefits for staff 

There are also key benefits for staff in including group sessions within your supervision:

- Manage workload efficiently
  - EXAMPLE/INFO
- Group together common queries and concerns
  - EXAMPLE/INFO
- Enjoy the group dynamic!
