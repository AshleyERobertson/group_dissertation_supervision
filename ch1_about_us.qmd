# About Us {#about_us}

## Who we are

We are [Dr Ashley Robertson](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/ashleyrobertson/){target="_blank"} and [Dr Holly Scott](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/hollyscott/){target="_blank"} and are both Lecturers in Psychology within the School of Psychology & Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow.  

We both run group dissertation supervision (although in different ways!) and we developed this joint resource to help others who want to run group dissertation supervision.  Through this book, we hope to provide some ideas of how you could incorporate group supervision in a way that works for you. You may or may not currently supervise in groups: either way, we will provide some ideas of activities you might want to try in group supervision, as well as make some suggestions about how you might want to structure group supervision.  

Although we come from a background of Psychology, we have purposely kept this resource general and open, so that it could apply to dissertation supervision across many disciplines.

## How to use the resource

This resource can be used however you want! Please feel free to use the information contained within it, to adapt it for your own uses, or to pass on to others.  

This book draws on what weâ€™ve both learned about group supervision and provides some resources for you to try out.  

In Appendix B [ADD LINK], you will also find a list of resources that might be useful for you in your supervision.
